# Interservice interaction with circular references

This module is just for testing purposes.

It tests interservice interaction with circular references.

In this example it works well with Spring autowiring feature.

According with Spring Doc http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-dependency-resolution unresolvable circular dependency scenario is possible only if using constructor injection.
